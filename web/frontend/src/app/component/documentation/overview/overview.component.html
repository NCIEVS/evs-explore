    <h4>Using the Search Box</h4>
  </span>
  <p>
    The <b>Search Box</b>, in the upper left of the EVS Explore Browser welcome page and search results pages
    and on other pages can be easily found by clicking the <b>Back to Search</b> button. There are a number
    of controls that can be used to tune searches.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Input Box:</b>Enter a string of at least 3 characters you want to search for.
      <ul>
        <li>Search is not case sensitive (e.g., <span class="tt">aids</span> will match <i>aids</i>, <i>Aids</i>, and
          <i>AIDS</i>).
        </li>
        <li> There are no wildcard characters. All characters are matched literally (e.g., searching for <b>Starts
            With</b>
          <span class="tt">NAT2*</span> will
          match <i>NAT2*5 Allele</i> but not <i>NAT2 Gene</i>).
        </li>
        <li>There is no need to use quotes as they will be ignored by searches</li>
        <li>Searching can be done with one or multiple words.</li>
        <li>The search is generally performed against the code, all of the concept names, all of the concept
          definitions, and all
          of the property values. The indexing is designed so that anything you would expect to be searchable should
          produce results.</li>
      </ul>

    </li>

    <li><b>Match type radio buttons</b> determine how your search string (entered into the <b>Input Box</b>) will be
      matched.
      <ul>
        <li><b>Contains</b> is the default type. It performs a search that looks for any or all words typed, favoring
          results with more words matched, and with words matched in order.</li>
        <li><b>Exact Match</b> performs a search that looks for matches having exactly the search words entered in the
          specified order.</li>
        <li><b>Starts With</b> performs a search that looks for matches starting with search words entered in the
          specified order.</li>
        <li><b>Phrase</b> performs a search that looks for matches containing all search words entered in the specified
          order (but does not require a match at the beginning or an exact match). Searches in this mode will
          also find all results returned by the same search using <b>Exact Match</b> or <b>Starts With</b>.</li>
        <li><b>Fuzzy</b> performs a search that looks for any or all words typed (or fuzzy variants of those words),
          favoring results with more words matched, and with words matched in order.</li>
        <li><b>AND</b> performs a search that looks for matches containing all words entered in any order.</li>
        <li><b>OR</b> performs a search that looks for matches containing any (or all) words entered. Searches in this
          mode will also find all results returned by the same search using <b>ALL</b>.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Source</b> dropdown allows searches to be restricted to those concepts having a synonym with "synonym source"
      matching one of the selected entries in the dropdown. For example, selecting <span class="tt">CDISC</span> will
      only return concepts with a CDISC synonym</li>
    <li><b>Search</b> button starts a search.</li>
    <li><b>Reset Search</b> button resets all search parameters and returns to the welcome screen.</li>
  </ul>

    <span style="float:right">[<a href="/overview#top" aria-label="Scroll to top">Top</a>]</span>
    <h4>Search Results</h4>
  </span>
  <p>
    When a search is performed, <b>Search Results</b> are displayed with some basic concept information
    and a link to load a dedicated view for just that one concept. Clicking this link opens that view
    in a new window. Other details:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>All matching concepts are returned.</li>
    <li>Results are listed from best match to weakest. For example, a <b>Contains</b> search on <span
        class="tt">Bone</span> returns <i>Bone</i> at the top,
      followed by concepts with two word matches (e.g., <i>Mouse Bone</i>), followed by concepts having less relevance.
    </li>
    <li>The total number of search results found along with the search time in milliseconds is shown at the top of the
      search results table.</li>
    <li>When a search is performed, it looks for matches among a variety of fields of the concept object, including
      the preferred name of concept, the code, the other synonyms of the concepts, the definitions of the concept,
      and the property values of the concept. For this reason, the match may be to something other than the preferred
      name
      of the concept.
    </li>
    <li>Search results are paged, with a default page size of 10. This can be adjusted with the page size control at
      the top and bottom of the search results table. The same control will also allow you to navigate to the next
      page of results (or the previous page where appropriate).
    </li>
    <li>The first column of the search results table contains a <i class="pi pi-chevron-right"></i> icon. When clicked,
      it reveals a panel beneath the corresponding search result that shows highlighted portions of the concept that
      were matched to the search text provided. </li>
    <li>By default, the search results table shows the concept code, the preferred name, synonyms, and definitions. The
      <b>Show Less</b> button can be clicked so only the code and preferred name are shown. In that mode, the <b>Show
        More</b> button can be clicked to toggle back to the default state. To the right of the <b>Show More</b> button
      is a control that allows you to select exactly which of the available columns you want shown in the search results
      display.
    </li>
    <li>If a concept is retired, this will be indicated by the phrase "(Retired Concept") next to the name of the
      concept in
      the Results listing.
    </li>
    <li>A <b>Back to Search</b> button appears in the upper right when you leave the results page to view
      concept details. Clicking that button will return you to the standard search view.
    </li>
    <li>A <b></b></li>
  </ul>

  <span>
    <span style="float:right">[<a href="/overview#top" aria-label="Scroll to top">Top</a>]</span>
    <h4>Concept Details</h4>
  </span>
  <p>
    Detailed information on a selected concept is shown when that concept code is selected from the search results.
    The concept detail view is loaded into a new tab for display.</p>
  <p>The top of this view shows the preferred name and concept code along with an <b>Open in
      Hierarchy"</b> button.
    Clicking on that button will open the <a href="/overview#hierarchy" aria-label="Scroll to hierarchy">hierarchy
      view</a>.
  </p>
  <p>Below that, there are three tabs: <b>Terms and Properties</b> (the default tab), <b>Relationships</b>, and <b>View
      All</b>.
    The contents of these tabs are described below. </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Terms and Properties</b> shows detailed information about the terms and properties of the concept being show.
      This information is broken down into five tables.
      <ul>
        <li>The first table shows top level information about the concept, including the preferred name, the display
          name, the label, and the concept code.</li>
        <li><b>Definitions</b> shows any concept definitions (or ALT_DEFINITIONs) in a sortable table. This table
          includes columns for the definition values themselves, source of the definition, and any associated
          attribution.</li>
        <li><b>Synonyms & Abbreviations</b> shows all of the terms associated with this concept in a sortable table.
          This table includes columns for the term, the sub-source, the term type, the sub-source code, and the
          sub-source name.</li>
        <li><b>Other Properties</b> shows other properties associated with the concept in a sortable table. This table
          includes columns for the property type and value. In some cases, property values may be linked out to external
          data sources that provide additional information about those values. For example, a "CAS_Registry" property
          will have its value linked out to <span class="tt">http://chem.sis.nlm.nih.gov/</span> to resollve that code.
        </li>
        <li><b>Maps To</b> shows information about maps to other terminologies in a sortable table.
          This table includes columns for the target name, relationship to target, target term type, target code,
          and the target terminology (and optionally version).</li>
      </ul>

    </li>
    <li><b>Relationships</b> shows information about related concepts. This information is broken down into seven
      tables.
      <ul>
        <li><b>Parent Concepts</b> shows basic information about parent concepts in a sortable table. This table
          includes columns for code and preferred name.
        </li>
        <li><b>Child Concepts</b> shows basic information about child concepts in a sortable table. This table includes
          columns for code and preferred name.
        </li>
        <li><b>Role Relationships</b> shows basic information about asserted or inherited role relationships, pointing
          from the current concept to other concepts in a sortable table. This table includes columns for code and
          preferred name.
        </li>
        <li><b>Associations</b> shows basic information about associations pointing from the current concept to other
          concepts in a sortable table. This table includes columns for code and preferred name.
        </li>
        <li><b>Incoming Role Relationships</b> shows basic information about asserted or inherited role relationships,
          pointing from other concepts to the current concept in a sortable table. This table includes columns for code
          and preferred name.
        </li>
        <li><b>Incoming Associations</b> shows basic information about associations pointing from other concepts to the
          current concept in a sortable table. This table includes columns for code and preferred name.
        </li>
        <li><b>Disjoint With</b> shows basic information about disjointness assertions between this concept and other
          concepts.
        </li>
      </ul>

    </li>
    <li><b>View All</b> combines the content of both views listed above into a single view.</li>
  </ul>

  <a name="hierarchy"></a>
  <span>
    <span style="float:right">[<a href="/overview#top" aria-label="Scroll to top">Top</a>]</span>
    <h4>Hierarchy</h4>
  </span>
  <p>The hierarchy view is enabled by clicking on the <b>Open in Hierarchy</b> button when viewing
    <a href="/overview#concept-details" aria-label="Scroll to concept details">concept details
    </a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this view, there is a <b>Concept Hierarchy</b> view along the left side of the display opened
    to reveal the full path from the root level of the tree to the currently selected concept.
    The entry for the current concept is highlighted and all sibling concepts and ancestor concepts
    are also shown in as represented in the hierarchy of the terminology. The page will automatically
    scroll to the selected concept in this view.
  </p>
  <p>
    Clicking on the <i class="pi pi-fw pi-chevron-right"></i> icon to the left of an concept in this view
    triggers a call to look up and display its child concepts.
  </p>
  <p>Clicking on a concept itself will change the focus of the display to that concept and load the
    corresponding concept detail information for that concept on the right side of the display.
  </p>

  <a name="documentation"></a>
  <span>
    <span style="float:right">[<a href="/overview#top" aria-label="Scroll to top">Top</a>]</span>
    <h4>Metadata Documentation</h4>
  </span>
  <p>
    Along the top toolbar, there is a "Documentation" dropdown that when clicked reveals
    a number of sub-entries for the various kinds of metadata, including: Associations,
    Properties, Qualifiers, Roles, Term Types, Sources, Synonym Types, and Definition Types.
  </p>
  <p>
    Choosing any of these items loads a sortable two or three-column table with the codes, names,
    and definitions of the metadata elements of the specified type.</p>
