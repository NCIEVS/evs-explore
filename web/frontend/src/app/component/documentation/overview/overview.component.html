    NCI Term Browser provides a consistent, user-friendly tool to browse, search and retrieve all of the biomedical
    terminologies hosted by EVS, including both NCI Thesaurus (NCIt) and the NCI Metathesaurus (NCIm), which itself
    includes more than 70 terminologies. The 2.0 major release added support for value sets (flat lists of terms from
    one
    or more terminologies used for a particular coding purpose) and mappings between terminologies to support data
    translation and cross-reference. For information on new features and known issues, see NCI Term Browser 2.18
    Release
    Notes.

    <h3>EVS Explore Welcome Page</h3>
  </span>
  <p>
    In the upper left of the NCI Term Browser home page are 3 tabs: the Terminologies tab (the default tab), the Value
    Sets tab, and the Mappings tab:
  </p>

  The Terminologies tab allows browsing and searching within each of the NCI hosted terminologies, or within multiple
  terminologies.
  The Value Sets tab allows browsing and searching within all value sets, such as the CDISC SDTM Terminology or the
  FDA
  SPL Terminology, available on the NCI server.
  The Mappings tab allows browsing and searching within a mapping set such as the PDQ to NCIt Mapping or the NCIt to
  ChEBI Mapping.
  These 3 tabs will appear at the top of every Term Browser page you are on, and the tab that is highlighted indicates
  which section of the Term Browser you are in. The NCI Term Browser icon above the tabs always leads back to the main
  Terminologies home page. The Term Browser and LexEVS terminology server versions are displayed in the browser's home
  page banner; for more information on LexEVS, see the LexEVS Wiki Pages.

  The NCI Term Browser home page contains a Search Box in the upper right hand corner. This Search Box has different
  options, and will bring back different results, depending on which tab you are on in the Term Browser.

  Several links appear below the Search Box. Most appear only in certain tabs or other settings, but these appear on
  the
  home pages of all tabs:

  Sources always appears at the left, and gives information about all terminologies and mappings including the
  descriptions that appear on their individual home pages.
  Visited Concepts will appear under the Search box once you start visiting individual concept pages. It shows the
  concept name, terminology, and version for each concept visited, with the most recent concepts at the top.
  Help always appears at the far right, linking to this Help page.

    <h3>Using the Search Box</h3>
  </span>
  The Search Box, in the upper right corner of the Term Browser home page and of most Term Browser pages, lets you
  enter
  all or part of what you are looking for and how you want to search for it. Some details:

  Text Box: Enter the string of characters you want to search for.
  Search is not case sensitive (e.g., aids will match aids, Aids, and AIDS).
  There are no wildcard characters. All characters are matched literally (e.g., searching for Begins With NAT2* will
  match NAT2*5 Allele but not NAT2 Gene).
  Do not use quotes - they will be searched for literally, as characters to be matched.
  Search multiple words requires that all search words be found in target terms. There are two different methods used:
  Method 1: For Exact Match and Begins With methods, and for all Property and Relationship targets, the words must be
  found together in the order entered with no separation.
  Method 2: Contains search on Name, however, now looks for those words separately. A special index makes these
  searches
  faster and more flexible than before, while still ranking best matches first. Note: The current implementation only
  finds matches at the start of words, not the middle or end; we plan to address this in a future release.
  For example, if you do a Contains search on Melanoma Cornea, no results will be returned, for any option covered
  under
  Method 1,but with Method 2 you will match Corneal Melanoma . Refinement of these methods is ongoing.
  Match method radio buttons select how your search string will be matched.
  Contains button is the default. It will search for what you enter at the start of any words in a Name search, or at
  the beginning or end of any words in a Property or Relationship search (e.g., adeno will match adenocarcinoma in all
  these searches, but carcinoma will only match it in Property or Relationship searches). For multiple word search,
  see
  description in the preceding section.
  Exact Match Only terms or codes that are identical will match.
  Begins With button can be selected to find all terms that start with the words or characters you enter. Codes cannot
  be searched this way.
  Concept Codes will only match if they exactly match what you enter. If you select a search target of Code and then
  the
  Begins With or Contains method button, the browser will switch to the default Name search target radio button.
  Match target radio buttons select what category of concept information is searched.
  Name button is the default: Search text is matched to a concept's preferred name, synonyms, or acronyms. Unless
  stated
  otherwise, all search examples in this Help page use the default name search.
  Code button is for searching concepts by code: Search text is matched to a concept code, or source code. The search
  is
  case-sensitive.
  Property button will match to other direct property attributes of a concept, such as definitions.
  Relationship button will return concepts that have relationships to concepts that match by name/code (e.g., an exact
  relationship search on hand does not return the concept Hand, but does return Finger and other related concepts that
  have relationships that point to Hand; note that the Hand concept's Relationships tab shows relationships that point
  from Hand to other concepts).
  Search button starts a search.
  The "?" button brings you to this Search section of the Help file.
  If you are in the NCI Term Browser home page, all currently selected terminologies on the Terminologies tab will be
  searched. When you are in the pages of a particular terminology, only that terminology will be searched. The banner
  to
  the left of the Search box tells you which terminology environment you are in.

  <a name="search-results"></a>
  <span>
    <span style="float:right">[<a href="/overview#top" aria-label="Scroll to top">Top</a>]</span>
    <h3>Search Results</h3>
  </span>
  When a terminologies search is run, Search Results are displayed by concept preferred name. If you are searching
  multiple terminologies, a right-hand column displays the corresponding name of the terminology for each matching
  concept. If there is only one match, the concept details page is shown directly without first listing results,
  unless
  the matching concept is in the NCI Metathesaurus (because this links to the separate NCIm Browser). Some details:

  All matching concepts are returned.
  Results are listed from best match to weakest. For example, a Contains search on Bone returns Bone at the top,
  followed by concepts with two word matches (e.g., Flat Bone), followed by concepts whose terms have more non- Bone
  content.
  When a terminology search is run, it looks for matches not only in the preferred name of concepts but also among the
  synonyms of the preferred name as listed in the concept details page. For this reason, the match will often be to
  synonyms or codes only visible on the concept details page (e.g., searching Begins With melanoma will show MIA in
  the
  results list because that concept contains a synonym of melanoma inhibitory activity.)
  If there are too many to show on one page, you can page through the results, with a default of 50 per page. To
  change
  the default number, use the Show results per page drop-down menu at the bottom of the results page.
  If a concept is retired, this will be indicated by the phrase "(Retired Concept") next to the name of the concept in
  the Results listing.
  Click on the preferred name to see a concept's details.
  A Back to search results link appears in the search box when you leave the results page for other pages in the
  Terminologies tab; click on the link to return to that last results page. If you run a new search or switch to
  another
  main browser tab, that results page is lost and the link disappears.

    <h3>Concept Details</h3>
  </span>
  <p>
    Detailed information on a selected concept is grouped and shown on several related pages:
  </p>
  <p>
    Tabbed information gives the concept's meaning, labels, and direct relationships:
    Terms & Properties: Gives definitions, synonyms, abbreviations, codes, and other information.
    Synonym Details: Shows each term or abbreviation with the corresponding term type, source, and code (for sources
    that
    have them).
    Relationships: Shows how other concepts are directly related to this concept as parents, children, or in other ways.
    For NCIt concepts, role relationships are grouped by the type of concept to which the concept is related, and, for
    concepts that have logical models built from their inter-concept relationships, there is a separate Logical
    Definition
    section showing the parent concepts and direct role assertions that define that concept. Note: For some sources, the
    browser adds inverse relationships not asserted bidirectionally in the source data file; this is often useful for
    informational and navigational purposes, but is sometimes confusing, and will continue to be evaluated for
    adjustments
    in future releases.
    Mappings: Gives the mapping relationships, if any, to other vocabularies.
    View All: Combines all of the concept details on a single page.
    Concept specific links provide additional information and actions, some limited to sources for which they are
    available:
    View in Hierarchy: Click the link to see where the concept is found within the terminology hierarchy. Concepts are
    often found in several different places. The focus concept will be bold, underlined, and colored red.
    View History: Click the link to see a history of changes made to the current concept, for sources that provide
    concept history data.
    View Graph: Click the link to see an interactive graphic presentation of some information available in the
    Relationships tab. The default displays all available relationships at once. A drop-down pick list allows choosing
    specific relationships for viewing.
    Add to Cart: For information about placing concepts into the Cart (using the Add to Cart link found on the Concept
    Details pages) in order to Export concept information to a file, please see below.
    Suggest Changes: This link appears in the upper right of all concept details pages of sources for which NCI can
    handle such requests. It goes to a special suggestion page with source and concept code filled in.

    <span style="float:right">[<a href="/overview#top" aria-label="Scroll to top">Top</a>]</span>
    <h3>Hierarchy</h3>
  </span>
  <p>
    Hierarchy: Click the link to bring up a separate window showing the full terminology hierarchy. Some details:
    At first, only the top level nodes of the hierarchy are shown.
    At each level, concepts are listed alphabetically by concept preferred name.
    Browse through the levels by clicking on the + next to each concept that has child concepts.
    Click on the concept name itself to see the concept's details in the main browser window.
    Value Sets: Click the link to bring up a separate window showing a hierarchy of the value sets defined using the
    terminology. Clicking on the name of a value set will bring up that value set's home page. Terminologies that do not
    have value sets will not have the Value Sets link (see the information on the Value Sets tab below).
    Maps: Click the link to bring up a list of the mapping data sets of the terminology, which can then be searched.
    Terminologies that do not have mappings will not have the Maps link (see the information on the Mappings tab below).

    <h3>Metadata Documentation</h3>
  </span>
  <p>
    Along the top toolbar, there is a "Documentation" dropdown that when clicked reveals
    a number of sub-entries for the various kinds of metadata, including: Associations,
    Properties, Qualifiers, Roles, Term Types, Sources, Synonym Types, and Definition Types.
  </p>
  <p>
    Choosing any of these items loads a two or three-column table with the codes, names,
    and definitions of the metadata elements of the specified type.</p>
