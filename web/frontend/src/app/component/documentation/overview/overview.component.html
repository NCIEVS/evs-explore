    <h4>Choosing a Terminology</h4>
  </span>
  <p>
    There are multiple terminologies available in the EVS Explore Browser. The user can choose a single terminology to search by using the <b>Terminology</b> dropdown in the upper right of the welcome page. The user can also choose to search multiple terminologies by selecting <b>Multiple Terminology Search</b> in the same dropdown, or by clicking the <b>Multiple Terminology Search</b> (<b style="color:red">D</b>) link on the right-hand side of the page. Both of these options will direct the user to the <b>Multiple Terminology Search</b> page.
  </p>
  <p>
    More information on the <b>Multiple Terminology Search</b> page can be found <a href="overview#multiterm" aria-label="Scroll to Using the Multiple Terminology Search">here</a>. A direct link to the page itself can be found <a href="welcome?terminology=multi" aria-label="Multiple Terminology Search">here</a>.

  <a name="search"></a>
  <span>
    <span style="float:right">[<a href="overview#top" aria-label="Scroll to top">Top</a>]</span>
    <h4>Using the Search Box</h4>
  </span>
  <p>
    The <b>Search Box</b> (<b style="color:red">E</b>) is located in the upper left of the EVS Explore Browser welcome page.
    You can also get to
    the search box from the search results pages by clicking the <b>New Search</b> button. There
    are a number
    of controls that can be used to fine-tune searches.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Input Box:</b> Enter a string containing at least 3 characters that you want to
      search for.
      <ul>
        <li>Search is not case sensitive (e.g., <span class="tt">aids</span> will match
          concepts containing <i>aids</i>,
          <i>Aids</i>, and <i>AIDS</i>).
        </li>
        <li>There are no wildcard characters. All characters are matched literally (e.g.,
          searching for <b>Starts
            With</b>
          <span class="tt"> NAT2*</span> will
          match <i>NAT2*5 Allele</i> but not <i>NAT2 Gene</i>).
        </li>
        <li>There is no need to surround search terms with quotes as they will be ignored
          during the search.
        </li>
        <li>Searching can be done using one word or multiple words.</li>
        <li>The search is generally performed against the code, all of the names and
          synonyms, all of the concept
          definitions, and all of the property values. The indexing is designed so that
          the most relevant data fields
          are searchable and should produce results.
        </li>
      </ul>

    </li>

    <li><b>Match type radio buttons</b> determine how your search string (entered into the
      <b>Input Box</b>) will be
      matched.
      <ul>
        <li><b>Contains</b> is the default type. It performs a search that looks for any
          words typed, favoring results
          with more words matched and with words matched in order.
        </li>
        <li><b>Exact Match</b> performs a search that looks for matches containing the exact
          strings in the order they
          were entered.
        </li>
        <li><b>Starts With</b> performs a search that looks for matches starting with all of
          the search words entered in
          the specified order.
        </li>
        <li><b>Phrase</b> performs a search that looks for the full string entered into the search box, without regard for its position. Searches in
          this mode will find all results returned by the same search using <b>Exact
            Match</b> or <b>Starts With</b>, as well as anything that merely <i>contains</i> the full string entered. For example, searching for <span class="tt">Blood Sample</span> will return <i>Blood Sample</i> and <i>Archived Newborn Blood Sample</i>, but not <i>sample of peripheral blood</i>.
        </li>
        <li><b>Fuzzy</b> finds results that include the words you type, along with similar "fuzzy" variations (e.g., "color" may also find "colour", and vice versa). It prioritizes results that match more words and keep them in the same order.
        </li>
        <li><b>AND</b> performs a search that looks for matches containing all of the words
          that were entered in any
          order.
        </li>
        <li><b>OR</b> performs a search that looks for matches containing any of the words
          entered. Searches in this
          mode will also find all results returned by the same search using <b>ALL</b>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Source</b> drop-down allows searches to be restricted to those concepts having a
      synonym with "synonym
      source"
      matching one of the selected entries in the drop-down. For example, selecting <span class="tt">CDISC</span> will
      only return concepts with a CDISC synonym
    </li>
    <li><b>Search</b> button starts a search.</li>
    <li><b>New Search</b> button resets all search parameters and returns to the <a href="overview#welcome"
                                                                                    aria-label="Scroll to welcome page">Welcome
      Page</a>.
    </li>
    <li><b>Terminology</b> dropdown allows the user to choose which terminology to perform a search
      in. Currently supported terminologies include:
      <ul>
        <li>NCI Thesaurus (NCIt)</li>

  </details>
  <p>
    The <b>Multiple Terminology Search</b> is located in the Terminology dropdown in the upper right of the EVS Explore
    Browser welcome page.
  </p>
  <p>
    Selecting <b>Multiple Terminology Search</b>, a new view is opened with a list of the all
    terminologies. Each terminology has a checkbox next to it for selecting the terminology to search in. At the top
    of the list, there are three preset selections to quickly select terminologies.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>All But NCIm</b>: checks all terminologies except for NCIm
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Select All</b>: checks every terminology in the list.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Clear</b>: unchecks all of the boxes for each terminology.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Once the terminologies are selected, enter the keyword or code in the <a href="overview#search"
                                                                             aria-label="Scroll to Using the Search Box"><b>Search
    Box</b></a>. The results will be pulled from the list of terminologies selected.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a terminology has a license requirement (such as MedDRA), a popup will appear before that terminology is selected. That
    terminology will only be checked if the license is accepted.

  </details>
  <p>
    When a search is performed, <b>Search Results</b> are displayed with some basic concept
    information
    and a link to load a dedicated view for just that one concept. Clicking this link opens that
    view
    in a new window. Other details:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>All matching concepts are returned.</li>
    <li>Results are listed from best match to weakest. For example, a <b>Contains</b> search on
      <span class="tt">Bone</span> returns the exact match <i>Bone</i> at the top,
      followed by concepts where one of two words match (e.g., <i>Mouse Bone</i>), followed by
      concepts having less
      relevance.
    </li>
    <li>The total number of search results found along with the search time in milliseconds is
      shown at the top of the
      search results table.
    </li>
    <li>When a search is performed, it looks for matches among a variety of fields found in the
      concept, including the
      preferred name of concept, the code, synonyms of the concept, the definitions of the
      concept, and the property
      values of the concept. For this reason, the results will include matches to data fields
      other than the preferred
      name of the concept.
    </li>
    <li>Search results are paged, with a default page size of 10. This can be adjusted using the
      page size control found
      at both the top and bottom of the search results table. The same control will also allow
      you to navigate to the
      next page of results (or the previous page where appropriate).
    </li>
    <li>By default, the search results table shows the highlights icon, the concept code, the
      preferred name, synonyms,
      and definitions. The <b>Search Result Details</b> (<b style="color:red">A</b>) drop-down can be clicked to reveal a
      control that allows you
      to select which of the data columns should be shown in the <b>Search Results</b>
      display.
    </li>
    <li>The first column of the <b>Search Results</b> (<b style="color:red">B</b>) table contains an icon. When clicked, it
      reveals a panel beneath
      the
      corresponding search result that shows highlighted portions of the concept that were
      matched to the search text
      provided.
    </li>
    <li>If a concept is retired, this will be indicated by the phrase "Retired Concept" next to
      the name of the concept
      in the Results listing.
    </li>
    <li>A <b>New Search</b> button appears in the upper right when you leave the results page to
      view
      <a href="overview#concept-details" aria-label="Scroll to concept details"><b>Concept

  <p>The <b>Subset Page</b> of EVS Explore supports the browsing of subsets, which are flat lists
    of member concepts intended for specific coding purposes. </p>
  <p>The <b>Subset Page</b> is enabled by clicking on the <b>Subsets</b> link along the top
    banner.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this page, there is a hierarchical view of the available subsets. Clicking on the <i

    to show its children. The <b>Expand All</b> (<b style="color:red">B</b>)  button near the page title will fully expand
    the tree to reveal all available subsets within the hierarchy.
  </p>
  <p>
    An individual subset can be selected by clicking on a row. This opens up a new window
    containing the <b>Subset Details View</b>. This view provides some information about
    the subset itself, including the code, the name, and the definition. If available, a link
    to download the subset from the FTP site is also provided.
  </p>
  <p>
    Below that is a table with details of the individual members of the subset. The exact format
    of this table varies slightly across different subsets. It provides basic high-level
    information about each member including information like the code, various names and synonyms,
    and one or more definitions for that member. At the top of this table is a <a href="overview#search"
