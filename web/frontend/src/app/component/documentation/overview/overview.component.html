    <span style="float:right">[<a href="overview#top" aria-label="Scroll to top">Top</a>]</span>
    <h4>Using the Search Box</h4>
  </span>
  <p>
    The <b>Search Box</b> is located in the upper left of the EVS Explore Browser welcome page.
    You can also get to
    the search box from the search results pages by clicking the <b>New Search</b> button. There
    are a number
    of controls that can be used to fine-tune searches.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Input Box:</b> Enter a string containing at least 3 characters that you want to
      search for.
      <ul>
        <li>Search is not case sensitive (e.g., <span class="tt">aids</span> will match
          concepts containing <i>aids</i>,
          <i>Aids</i>, and <i>AIDS</i>).
        </li>
        <li>There are no wildcard characters. All characters are matched literally (e.g.,
          searching for <b>Starts
            With</b>
          <span class="tt"> NAT2*</span> will
          match <i>NAT2*5 Allele</i> but not <i>NAT2 Gene</i>).
        </li>
        <li>There is no need to surround search terms with quotes as they will be ignored
          during the search.</li>
        <li>Searching can be done using one word or multiple words.</li>
        <li>The search is generally performed against the code, all of the names and
          synonyms, all of the concept
          definitions, and all of the property values. The indexing is designed so that
          the most relevant data fields
          are searchable and should produce results.</li>
      </ul>

    </li>

    <li><b>Match type radio buttons</b> determine how your search string (entered into the
      <b>Input Box</b>) will be
      matched.
      <ul>
        <li><b>Contains</b> is the default type. It performs a search that looks for any
          words typed, favoring results
          with more words matched and with words matched in order.</li>
        <li><b>Exact Match</b> performs a search that looks for matches containing the exact
          strings in the order they
          were entered.</li>
        <li><b>Starts With</b> performs a search that looks for matches starting with all of
          the search words entered in
          the specified order.</li>
        <li><b>Phrase</b> performs a search that looks for matches containing all search
          words entered in the specified
          order (but does not require the match to be at the beginning of the concept or
          an exact match). Searches in
          this mode will also find all results returned by the same search using <b>Exact
            Match</b> or <b>Starts
            With</b>.</li>
        <li><b>Fuzzy</b> performs a search that looks for any words typed and for fuzzy
          variants of those words,
          favoring results with more words matched, and with words matched in order.</li>
        <li><b>AND</b> performs a search that looks for matches containing all of the words
          that were entered in any
          order.</li>
        <li><b>OR</b> performs a search that looks for matches containing any of the words
          entered. Searches in this
          mode will also find all results returned by the same search using <b>ALL</b>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Source</b> drop-down allows searches to be restricted to those concepts having a
      synonym with "synonym
      source"
      matching one of the selected entries in the drop-down. For example, selecting <span class="tt">CDISC</span> will
      only return concepts with a CDISC synonym</li>
    <li><b>Search</b> button starts a search.</li>
    <li><b>New Search</b> button resets all search parameters and returns to the <a href="overview#welcome"
        aria-label="Scroll to welcome page">Welcome Page</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <a name="search-results"></a>
  <span>
    <span style="float:right">[<a href="overview#top" aria-label="Scroll to top">Top</a>]</span>
    <h4>Search Results</h4>
  </span>
  <p>
    When a search is performed, <b>Search Results</b> are displayed with some basic concept
    information
    and a link to load a dedicated view for just that one concept. Clicking this link opens that
    view
    in a new window. Other details:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>All matching concepts are returned.</li>
    <li>Results are listed from best match to weakest. For example, a <b>Contains</b> search on
      <span class="tt">Bone</span> returns the exact match <i>Bone</i> at the top,
      followed by concepts where one of two words match (e.g., <i>Mouse Bone</i>), followed by
      concepts having less
      relevance.
    </li>
    <li>The total number of search results found along with the search time in milliseconds is
      shown at the top of the
      search results table.</li>
    <li>When a search is performed, it looks for matches among a variety of fields found in the
      concept, including the
      preferred name of concept, the code, synonyms of the concept, the definitions of the
      concept, and the property
      values of the concept. For this reason, the results will include matches to data fields
      other than the preferred
      name of the concept.
    </li>
    <li>Search results are paged, with a default page size of 10. This can be adjusted using the
      page size control found
      at both the top and bottom of the search results table. The same control will also allow
      you to navigate to the
      next page of results (or the previous page where appropriate).
    </li>
    <li>By default, the search results table shows the highlights icon, the concept code, the
      preferred name, synonyms,
      and definitions. The <b>Search Result Details</b> drop-down can be clicked to reveal a
      control that allows you
      to select which of the data columns should be shown in the <b>Search Results</b>
      display.
    </li>
    <li>The first column of the <b>Search Results</b> table contains an icon. When clicked, it
      reveals a panel beneath
      the
      corresponding search result that shows highlighted portions of the concept that were
      matched to the search text
      provided.</li>
    <li>If a concept is retired, this will be indicated by the phrase "Retired Concept" next to
      the name of the concept
      in the Results listing.
    </li>
    <li>A <b>New Search</b> button appears in the upper right when you leave the results page to
      view
      concept details. Clicking that button will return you to the standard search view.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <a name="concept-details"></a>
  <span>
    <span style="float:right">[<a href="overview#top" aria-label="Scroll to top">Top</a>]</span>
    <h4>Concept Details</h4>
  </span>
  <p>
    Detailed information on a selected concept is shown when that concept code is clicked in the
    <b>Search Results</b>.
    The concept detail view is loaded into a new tab for display.
  </p>
  <p>The top of this view shows the preferred name and concept code along with an <b>Open in
      Hierarchy</b> button.
    Clicking on that button will open the <a href="overview#hierarchy" aria-label="Scroll to hierarchy">hierarchy
      view</a>.
  </p>
  <p>Below that, there are three tabs: <b>Terms and Properties</b>, <b>Relationships</b>, and
    <b>View
      All</b>. The application remembers your last selection among these three tabs and will
    default to that view until
    you change it. The contents of these tabs are described below.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Terms and Properties</b> shows detailed information about the terms and properties of
      the concept being show.
      This information is broken down into five tables.
      <ul>
        <li>The first table shows top level information about the concept, including the
          preferred name, the display
          name, the label, and the concept code.</li>
        <li><b>Definitions</b> shows any concept definitions in a sortable table. This table
          includes columns for the
          definition text, the source of the definition, and any associated
          attribution(s).</li>
        <li><b>Synonyms & Abbreviations</b> shows all of the terms associated with this
          concept in a sortable table.
          This table includes columns for the term, the sub-source, the term type, the
          sub-source code, and the
          sub-source name.</li>
        <li><b>Other Properties</b> shows other properties associated with the concept in a
          sortable table. This table
          includes columns for the property type and value. In some cases, property values
          may be linked out to external
          data sources that provide additional information about those values. For
          example, a "CAS_Registry" property
          will have its value linked out to <a href="https://chem.nlm.nih.gov/">https://chem.nlm.nih.gov</a> to
          display the data attached to the identifier by the original source, in this case
          an NIH ChemID.
        </li>
        <li><b>Maps To</b> and <b>Mappings</b> show information about maps to other terminologies in a sortable table.
          This table includes columns for the target name, relationship to target, target term type, target code, and
          the target terminology (and the target terminology version if available).</li>
      </ul>

    </li>
    <li><b>Relationships</b> shows information about related concepts. This information is
      broken down into several tables. Clicking on the preferred name of a related concept will launch a new browser tab
      with the concept details for that related concept.
      <ul>
        <li><b>Parent Concepts</b> shows basic information about parent concepts in a sortable table. This table
          includes columns for code and preferred name.
        </li>
        <li><b>Child Concepts</b> shows basic information about child concepts in a sortable table. This table includes
          columns for code and preferred name.
        </li>
        <li><b>Role Relationships</b> shows basic information about asserted or inherited role relationships, pointing
          from the current concept to other concepts in a sortable table. This table includes columns for code and
          preferred name.
        </li>
        <li><b>Associations</b> shows basic information about associations pointing from the current concept to other
          concepts in a sortable table. This table includes columns for code and preferred name.
        </li>
        <li><b>Incoming Role Relationships</b> shows basic information about asserted or inherited role relationships,
          pointing from other concepts to the current concept in a sortable table. This table includes columns for code
          and preferred name.
        </li>
        <li><b>Incoming Associations</b> shows basic information about associations pointing from other concepts to the
          current concept in a sortable table. This table includes columns for code and preferred name.
        </li>
        <li><b>Disjoint With</b> shows basic information about disjointness assertions
          between this concept and other
          concepts.
        </li>
      </ul>

    </li>
    <li><b>View All</b> combines the content of both views listed above into a single view.</li>
  </ul>

  <a name="subsets"></a>
  <span>
    <span style="float:right">[<a href="overview#top" aria-label="Scroll to top">Top</a>]</span>
    <h4>Subsets</h4>
  </span>
  <p>The <b>Subset View</b> of EVS Explore supports the browsing of subsets, which are flat lists
    of member concepts intended for specific coding purposes. </p>
  <p>The <b>Subset View</b> is enabled by clicking on the <b>Subsets</b> link along the top banner.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this view, there is a hierarchical view of the available subsets. Clicking on the <i
      class="pi pi-fw pi-chevron-right"></i> to the left of a subset entry expands the view
    to show its children. The <b>Expand All</b> button near the page title will fully expand
    the tree to reveal all available subsets.
  </p>
  <p>
    An individual subset can be selected by clicking on a row. This opens up a new window
    containing the <b>Subset Details View</b>. This view provides some information about
    the subset itself, including the code, the name, and the definition. If available, a link
    to download the subset from the FTP site is also provided.
  </p>
  <p>
    Below that is a table with details of the individual members of the subset. The exact format
    of this table varies slightly across different subsets. It provides basic high-level
    information about each member including information like the code, various names and synonyms, and one
    or more definitions for that member. At the top of this table is a <b>Search Box</b> that can be
    used to restrict to only those member concepts whose contents are matches to the search text
    provided. Click the <b>Reset</b> button to clear any search text and retrieve the full list.
  </p>

  <a name="hierarchy"></a>
  <span>
    <span style="float:right">[<a href="overview#top" aria-label="Scroll to top">Top</a>]</span>
    <h4>Hierarchy</h4>
  </span>
  <p>The hierarchy view is enabled by clicking on the <b>Open in Hierarchy</b> button when viewing
    <a href="overview#concept-details" aria-label="Scroll to concept details">concept details
    </a> or by clicking on the <b>Hierarchy</b> link in the top banner.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this view, there is a <b>Concept Hierarchy</b> view along the left side of the display opened to reveal the full
    path from the root level of the tree to the currently selected concept. The entry for the current concept is
    highlighted and all sibling concepts and ancestor concepts are also shown in as represented in the hierarchy of the
    terminology. The page will automatically scroll to the selected concept in this view.
  </p>
  <p>
    Clicking on the <i class="pi pi-fw pi-chevron-right"></i> to the left of a concept in this
    view triggers a call to look up and display its child concepts.
  </p>
  <p>Clicking on a concept itself will change the focus of the display to that concept and load the corresponding
    concept detail information for that concept on the right side of the display.
  </p>

  <a name="documentation"></a>
  <span>
    <span style="float:right">[<a href="overview#top" aria-label="Scroll to top">Top</a>]</span>
    <h4>Metadata Documentation</h4>
  </span>
  <p>
    Along the top toolbar, there is a <b>Documentation</b> drop-down that when clicked reveals a number of sub-entries
    for the various kinds of metadata, including: Associations, Properties, Qualifiers, Roles,
    Term Types, Sources, Synonym Types, and Definition Types.
  </p>
