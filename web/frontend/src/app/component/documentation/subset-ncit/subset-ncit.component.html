        NCIt Thesaurus Subsets
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>There are over 500 specially defined subsets in NCI Thesaurus. Each has its own NCIt concept, defining the nature of the subset, and these are hierarchically organized under the parent concept  <a [routerLink]="['/concept/', C54443]" target="_blank">Terminology Subset (C54443)</a>. These subset concepts are linked to subset-member concepts through over 20,000 association relationships. Most of these subsets are now also available <a [routerLink]="['/subsets/']" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

  <p>Most NCIt subsets are federal and international coding standards maintained in active collaboration with our FDA, CDISC, and other partners. They are currently distributed largely as tab-delimited data and Excel spreadsheet files accessible from the <a href="http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1" target="_blank">EVS FTP site</a>. Below are five important subset collections currently presented on these Cancer.gov Web pages:</p>
