  <p>*Note on special rules governing NCI PT, HD, and AQ term types: Each concept should have one, and only one, term
    coded with one of these three values. The NCI Preferred Term is always taken from one of the NCI terms, normally
    that with a type of PT (Preferred Term). However, in special cases, a concept will not have a PT term, but instead,
    will have either an HD (Header) term or an AQ term. These tags are considered equivalent to PT by the software. This
    means that a concept may have only as single NCI PT, or HD, or AQ term. In those cases where multiple antiquated
    terms are needed for a concept which is itself coded as antiquated, one should be tagged AQ and the rest tagged AQS.
