    <p *ngIf="terminology == 'ncit'">*Note on special rules governing NCI PT, HD, and AQ term
        groups: Each concept should
        have one, and only one, term
        coded with one of these three values. The NCI Preferred Term is always taken from one of the
        NCI terms, normally
        that with a type of PT (Preferred Term). However, in special cases, a concept will not have
        a PT term, but instead,
        will have either an HD (Header) term or an AQ term. These tags are considered equivalent to
        PT by the software. This
        means that a concept may have only as single NCI PT, or HD, or AQ term. In those cases where
        multiple antiquated
        terms are needed for a concept which is itself coded as antiquated, one should be tagged AQ
        and the rest tagged AQS.
